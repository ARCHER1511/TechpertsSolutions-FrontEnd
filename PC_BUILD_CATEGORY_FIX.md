# PC Build Category Product Retrieval Fix

## Problem Description
The PC build system was returning empty products when retrieving products according to category. The issue was in the category details component which was using the wrong API approach to fetch products by category.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Wrong API Usage**: The category details component was using `ProductService.getAllProducts()` with a categoryId parameter instead of using the proper Category API endpoints.
2. **Missing Category Service Methods**: The CategoryService was missing methods to get category details and products by category.
3. **Incorrect Category Mapping**: The selector component had mismatched category names and IDs.
4. **Missing Category Images**: Some category images referenced in the categories component didn't exist.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CategoryService (`src/app/Services/category.service.ts`)
- **Added `getCategoryById(id: string)`**: Uses the proper API endpoint `/api/Category/GetCategory/{Id}` to fetch category details with products
- **Added `getProductsByCategory(categoryId: string)`**: Alternative method to get products by category
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for SSL certificate issues and API failures
- **Added Debug Logging**: Added console logs to help track API calls and responses

### 2. Updated CategoryDetailsComponent (`src/app/components/categories/category-details/category-details.component.ts`)
- **Changed from ProductService to CategoryService**: Now uses the proper CategoryService to fetch products
- **Updated Product Mapping**: Properly maps category products to IProduct interface
- **Enhanced Category Mapping**: Added all PC build categories (RAM, Storage, Power Supply, etc.)
- **Added Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track the product loading process
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and loading states

### 3. Updated SelectorComponent (`src/app/components/pc-build/selector/selector.component.ts`)
- **Added Category IDs**: Each component now has a proper category ID that matches the routing
- **Enhanced Category Mapping**: Added mapping between category names and component names
- **Updated Navigation**: Fixed navigation to use category IDs instead of names
- **Added Debug Logging**: Added logging for product selection

### 4. Updated CategoriesComponent (`src/app/components/categories/categories.component.ts`)
- **Added All PC Build Categories**: Added all categories needed for PC building
- **Fixed Image References**: Used available images and provided fallback images for missing ones
- **Added Debug Logging**: Added logging for category navigation

## API Endpoints Used
Based on the provided API documentation, the following endpoints are now properly integrated:

- `GET /api/Category/All` - Get all categories (used in PC Compare component)
- `GET /api/Category/GetCategory/{Id}` - Get category by ID with products (used in Category Details component)
- `POST /api/Category/Create` - Create new category (not used in frontend)
- `PUT /api/Category/Update/{Id}` - Update category (not used in frontend)
- `DELETE /api/Category/Delete/{Id}` - Delete category (not used in frontend)
- `POST /api/Category/{categoryId}/upload-image` - Upload category image (not used in frontend)
- `DELETE /api/Category/{categoryId}/delete-image` - Delete category image (not used in frontend)

## Testing Steps
1. **Navigate to Categories**: Go to `/categories` to see all available categories
2. **Select a Category**: Click on any category (e.g., "Processors", "Graphics Cards")
3. **Verify Products Load**: Check that products are displayed for the selected category
4. **Select a Product**: Click "Select Product" to add it to the PC build
5. **Check Selector**: Verify the product appears in the PC build selector
6. **Test All Categories**: Repeat for all PC build categories

## Debug Information
The application now includes comprehensive logging to help debug any issues:

- **Category API Calls**: Logs when category API endpoints are called
- **Product Loading**: Logs the number of products loaded for each category
- **Product Selection**: Logs when products are selected for PC build
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error messages for API failures

## Expected Behavior
After these fixes:
1. ✅ Categories page shows all PC build categories
2. ✅ Clicking a category navigates to category details page
3. ✅ Category details page loads and displays products from the API
4. ✅ Products can be selected and added to PC build
5. ✅ PC build selector properly manages selected components
6. ✅ All category-to-component mappings work correctly

## Troubleshooting
If products still appear empty:
1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for API error messages
2. **Verify Backend**: Ensure the backend API is running and accessible
3. **Check SSL Certificate**: Accept the development SSL certificate if prompted
4. **Verify API Endpoints**: Ensure the backend implements the expected Category API endpoints
5. **Check Network Tab**: Verify API calls are being made and responses received
